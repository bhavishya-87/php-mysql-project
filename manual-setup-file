Manual Version for setup 
-> Run the commands 
-> yum install docker 
-> systemctl start docker 
-> docker network create app_new_network --driver bridge 
-> docker run -itd --name app -p 8080:80 -v /php-mysql-project:/var/www/html/ --network app_new_network ubuntu:14.04 
-> docker run -itd --name db --network app_new_network -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=redhat -e MYSQL_USER=any -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=redhat -e MYSQL_DATABASE=goals mysql

Now after running these commands follow the procedure in the "app" container: 
// going inside in the "app" container 
-> docker attach app 
After comming to the container install php and in ubuntu:14.04 we have php5 version present, so 
-> apt update && apt upgrade
-> apt install php5 Also for installing php server 
-> apt install apache2 
-> apachectl restart

Now after the setup of "app" container, we have to setup database container that is "db": 
// for goins inside the "db" container 
-> docker exec -it db bash 
-> mysql -u root -p After typing the above command enter the password that is "redhat" 
-> use goals; 
-> CREATE TABLE goals( goal_id int(100), goal_category int(100), goal_text varchar(100), goal_date date, goal_complete int(100) ); 
-> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'redhat'; 
-> exit;

After exiting we need to setup some more thing 
-> cd /etc/ 
-> cat my.cnf 
After the above command copy the content shown after the command and paste in your notepad. Now paste a line given below next to the line "user=mysql" 
-> default_authentication_plugin=caching_sha2_password
